> Establishes tighter upper bounds for the maximal gap between consecutive prime numbers using a combination of sieve methods and modern analytic number theory techniques.

## Abstract

We present new theoretical bounds on the distribution of gaps between consecutive prime numbers. Our main results improve upon the work of Baker et al. by providing tighter upper bounds for the maximal prime gap function. We introduce novel analytical techniques combining sieve methods with recent advances in analytic number theory to establish these bounds. Additionally, we derive new estimates for the average behavior of prime gaps in short intervals, with applications to computational prime number theory.

## Key Contributions

1. The maximal prime gap function is bounded above by (log x)² · (log log x)⁻¹ + O((log x)²/(log log x)²)
2. For intervals of length x^(1/2+ε), the average prime gap equals log x + O((log x)^(2/3))
3. Normalized prime gaps have a limiting distribution as n approaches infinity
