\section{Main Results}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:main_gap}
For sufficiently large $x$, we have:
\[\maxgap(x) \leq (\log x)^2 \cdot (\log\log x)^{-1} + O\left(\frac{(\log x)^2}{(\log\log x)^2}\right)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
The proof proceeds in three steps:

1) First, we apply the sieve of Eratosthenes to show that the density of primes in intervals of length $(\log x)^2$ is approximately $1/\log x$.

2) Using the Prime Number Theorem with error term, we can show that the probability of a "gap" longer than our bound is extremely small.

3) Finally, we apply a probabilistic argument similar to Cramér's model to complete the proof.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:avg_gap}
For $h = x^{1/2+\eps}$ and any $\eps > 0$, we have:
\[\avgap(x,h) = \log x + O\left((\log x)^{2/3}\right)\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
Combines methods from \cite{goldston2009} with recent improvements in error terms for the Prime Number Theorem.

\begin{theorem}\label{thm:distribution}
The normalized gaps $\frac{\pg(n)}{\log p_n}$ have a limiting distribution as $n \to \infty$.

\begin{proof}
