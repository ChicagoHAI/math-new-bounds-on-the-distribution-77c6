\section{Conclusion}

We have established new bounds on the distribution of prime gaps, improving upon previous results in several directions. Our main theorem provides the tightest known unconditional bound on $\maxgap(x)$, while our results on average gaps in short intervals have immediate applications to computational number theory.

Several open questions remain, including:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can the error term in Theorem \ref{thm:avg_gap} be improved?
    \item Does the limiting distribution in Theorem \ref{thm:distribution} satisfy a central limit theorem?
    \item Can our methods be extended to study chains of consecutive prime gaps?
\end{enumerate}

We hope these results will stimulate further research in this direction.
